# K-Means-Clustering-on-High-Dimensional-Data

KMeans is one of the most popular clustering algorithms, and sci-kit learn has made it easy to implement without us going too much into mathematical details. How does KMeans work under the hood? Maybe thatâ€™s a story for another time. Today we will see how we can use KMeans to cluster data, especially data with higher dimensions. Statistics defines dimensionality as the attributes or features a dataset has, and the data that we are working today with is Wine-dataset which has 13 dimensions. Each wine has 13 factors that contributed to its awesome taste and we will make KMeans work, to group similar wines together.
